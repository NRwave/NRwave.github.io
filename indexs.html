      Data Science</strong>
  </h1>
  <img src="Opening_Image.png">
</body>

<body>
  <h2>Abstract</h2>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"> Since America's founding in the late 1700s, many foreign immigrants have traveled to
    America to experience liberty,
    freedom, and chances for success. Hence, America has transformed into a "Melting Pot" of cultures and
    perspectives.
    Consequently, I want to perform data visualization statistics to portray the well-being of ethnic and racial
    diversity and compare the two types of diversity. In this way, we gain insight into how America harnesses the
    power
    of diversity and thus improve our facilities to shape a better America for everyone! </p>

  <h2>Terms to Know</h2>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p> Standard Error: It represents the average disparity between predicted and actual
  values, especially for non-linear regression models. It is derived by square rooting the sum of the
  residuals(differences between predicted and actual values) divided by the number of data points.</p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>R²: Represents the coefficient of determination(how well regression models
  predict
  the actual values on the y-axis).</p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Outlier: data point with a drastic difference in the overall distribution</p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Ethnicity: Shared cultural characteristics such as language and cultural
  traditions
  </p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Race: Shared physical characteristics such as the physical color of a person.</p>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Racial Diversity Section: For this section increase in rank is 50th, 49th, etc.
  while decrease in rank is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.</p>

  <h2>Diversity versus Population</h2>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Since the founding of the United States, many believe that with more population,
  the melting pot of cultures grows. However, the correlation between population and diversity index seems to be
  non-linear:</p>

  <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
    src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/185.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
  <p style="font-family:Ariel">The actual equation I used to find the Standard Residual Error was 41.123 + 6.093ln(x).
    However, I had the equation as only 6.093ln(x) as it would not make sense for a state or national capital to have
    a
    diversity index as 47.216%(when substituting 0 people in for x) with no population at all.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Indeed, states with high populations like California and Texas have a greater
  diversity index while states with less concentration of people such as Maine and Vermont are less diverse. However,
  places with less population like Hawaii, Nevada, and Washington D.C seem to possess high racial diversity. Hence,
  the
  logarithmic regression shows that states are finding ways to maintain a diverse environment despite less population
  due to their high demand. Despite the graph shaping to be logarithmic to some extent, the model unveils a standard
  error of 13.057% in the diversity index. Thus, there seems to be high variation, especially for states with
  populations between 0 and 20 million. Nevertheless, the high concentration of racially diverse but less populous
  states on top of highly diverse and populous states reveals potential for the logarithmic model. Even so, the
  logarithmic model I have right now is not perfect due to a high variation in the diversity index.</p>

  <h2>Diverse Culture</h2>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>It is clear that America's diversity is scattered across the nation. Now, let's
  break down America's cultural environment on the ethnic level through analyzing the trends concerning languages and
  cultural traditions. After all, The United States has a vibrant story to tell about the many cultures that make up
  America's populace. This is true for America's popular world languages because states represent a multitude of
  languages besides English and Spanish(as shown below):
  </p>
  <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
    src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/113.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p style="font-family:verdana"></p>Here, we can see
  that a little over half the country possesses a high
  concentration of people speaking German(13 states),
  French(7 states), or Chinese(6 states).
  However, what is most significant here is that the
  amount of German speaking states(13) is actually a
  significantly high outlier here. This seems to be explained by the established German Culture in the Plains(many
  Plain
  States have a high concentration of Germans) ever since the high immigration/migration by Europeans toward the
  plains
  to continue their agricultural traditions. The phenomenon of mass immigration and migration can also be seen with
  popular languages such as French and Chinese from voyages and territorial expansion and cross country immigration,
  respectively. After all, according to the graph, the bulk of French speaking states are in the Northeast and
  Louisiana, centers of French influence in colonial and early America. In regards for the Chinese, many Chinese
  concentrated states are on the West, where Chinese community was established from the Gold Rush and the East coasts
  due to migration.

  <p style="font-family: verdana"></p>With the rising
  diversity and diffusion of language across the nation,
  let's observe the response to the rise of linguistic
  diversity, notable through the language translation
  industry:</p>
