      <h2>Abstract</h2>
    </u>
    <p style="font-stretch:condensed;">
      Since America's founding in the late 1700s, many foreign immigrants have traveled to
      America to experience liberty,
      freedom,
      and chances for success. Hence,
      America has transformed into a "Melting Pot"of cultures and perspectives. Consequently,
      I want to perform data visualization statistics to portray the well-being of ethnic and racial diversity and
      compare
      the two types of diversity. In this way,
      we gain insight into how America harnesses the power of diversity and thus improve our facilities to shape a
      better
      America for everyone ! </p>

      <h2>Diversity versus Population</h2>
    </u>
    <p></p>Since the founding of the United States,
    many believe that with more population,
    the melting pot of cultures grows. However,
    the correlation between population and diversity index seems to be non-linear:</p>
    '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/185.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
    <p>The actual equation I used to find the Standard Residual Error was 41.123+6.093ln(x).
      However,
      I had the equation as only 6.093ln(x) as it would not make sense for a state or national capital to have a
      diversity
      index as 47.216%(when substituting 0 people in for x) with no population at all.</p>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p></p>Indeed,
    states with high populations like California and Texas have a greater diversity index while states with less
    concentration of people such as Maine and Vermont are less diverse. However,
    places with less population like Hawaii,
    Nevada,
    and Washington D.C seem to possess high racial diversity. Hence,
    the logarithmic regression shows that states are finding ways to maintain a diverse environment despite less
    population due to their high demand. Despite the graph shaping to be logarithmic to some extent,
    the model unveils a standard error of 13.057% in the diversity index. Thus,
    there seems to be high variation,
    especially for states with populations between 0 and 20 million. Nevertheless,
    the high concentration of racially diverse but less populous states on top of highly diverse and populous states
    reveals potential for the logarithmic model. Even so,
    the logarithmic model I have right now is not perfect due to a high variation in the diversity index.</p>

      <h2>Diverse Culture</h2>
    </u>
    <p></p>It is clear that America's diversity is scattered across the nation. Now, let's
    break down America's cultural environment on the ethnic level through analyzing the trends concerning languages and
    cultural traditions. After all,
    The United States has a vibrant story to tell about the many cultures that make up America's populace. This is true
    for America's popular world languages because states represent a multitude of languages besides English and
    Spanish(as
    shown below): </p><iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/197.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p></p>Here,
    we can see that a little over half the country possesses a high concentration of people speaking German(13 states),
    French(7 states),
    or Chinese(6 states). However,
    what is most significant here is that the amount of German speaking states(13) is actually a significantly high
    outlier here. This seems to be explained by the established German Culture in the Plains(many Plain States have a
    high
    concentration of Germans) ever since the high immigration/migration by Europeans toward the plains to continue their
    agricultural traditions. The phenomenon of mass immigration and migration can also be seen with popular languages
    such
    as French and Chinese from voyages and territorial expansion and cross country immigration,
    respectively. After all,
    according to the graph,
    the bulk of French speaking states are in the Northeast and Louisiana,
    centers of French influence in colonial and early America. In regards for the Chinese,
    many Chinese concentrated states are on the West,
    where Chinese community was established from the Gold Rush and the East coasts due to migration. </p>
    <p style="font-family: verdana"></p>With the rising diversity and diffusion of language across the nation,
    let's observe the response to the rise of linguistic
    diversity,
    notable through the language translation industry:</p><iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;"
      seamless="seamless" src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/205.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
    <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/207.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p style="font-family: verdana"></p>Here, the language translation employment is increasing at an average of
    approximately 5,545 employees per year. Additionally, the R² is at a strong 0.979, meaning that 97.9% of the total
    employment is accurately accounted for by the regression line. However, per the second graph, the acceleration of
    employment seems to slow between 2020 and 2023. After all 2023, growth is expected to slow from 9,237(from 2022)
    employees per year to 7,129 employees per year. Even still, 2023's growth rate(7,129 employees per year) is at the
    70%
    percentile out of all the growth rates, proving America's aggressive effort in hiring more translators and thus
    investing in making the vast amount of diverse voices heard.

    <p style="font-family: verdana"></p>On top of languages, America does host a variety of highly popular(and
    internationally recognized) cultural festivals:</p>

    <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/134.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
    <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/136.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p style="font-family: verdana"></p>According to the latitude and longitude map, there seems to be even distribution
    of popular cultural celebrations in each half of the United States. After all, the eastern half presents culturally
    diverse cities such as New York(which hosts two popular festivals(Puerto Rican and Brazilian Day)) and Dublin, Ohio.
    In the Western half, on the other hand, the Native American influence has given birth to celebrations such as the
    Cherokee National Holiday in Oklahoma. Apart from this, the European and Asian influence in the West during the
    nineteenth century has also brought rise to New Ulm's German festival and San Francisco's Chinese New Year. Also,
    there seem to be mixed culture festivals in states such as such as Louisiana due to the presence of French and
    African
    cultures. As per the bar graph, America predominately has popular events(8 festivals) celebrating cultures from the
    western hemisphere, but the notable implementation of eastern cultures(4 festivals) and mixed(2 festivals) shows
    America's recognition of cultural diversity.</p>

      <h2> Are Racial Groups Equipped for Success?</h2>
    </u>
    <p style="font-family: verdana"></p>Although it is clear that America is promoting its diversity on the ethnic
    level,
    America can tell a different story of the well-being of race. Let's analyze the correlations between racial equality
    and the overall quality of the state economy, education, and healthcare system to evaluate how much success racial
    communities have in America.</p>
    <p style="font-family: verdana"></p>Let's look at state economies first(this was 2023 Data):</p>
    <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/199.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p style="font_family: verdana"></p>Here, for every increase in equality rank, the rank of the economy overall
    increases by 0.186. After all, it is true that with
    diversity, more perspectives and ideas from employees
    can be implemented in innovating and creating products
    and inventions, hence improving profit. However, despite the slight positive correlation , there seems to be a high
    variation in overall ranking. This is true with the regression line's very low R² of 0.0035(only 3.5% of the data
    can
    be explained by the regression). Washington D.C(Overall Ranking: 8th) and Utah(Overall Ranking: 2nd) especially
    contribute to the high variation. Despite their economic quality being within the top ten, they have average racial
    equality rankings of 51st and 30th respectively. Hence this shines light on the presence of uneven distribution of
    economic opportunities for those states. Notably, however, struggling states like Alaska(Overall Ranking: 49th) and
    Hawaii(Overall Ranking: 47th), are 1st and 6th in economic equality, respectively due to their high inclusiveness in
    industries.</p>
    <p style="font_family: verdana"></p> Let's look at state education systems next(this was 2023 Data):
    '<iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/201.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>'
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p style="font_family: verdana"></p>Here, there seems to be a negative correlation in equality and overall education
    ranking as for every increase in equality rank, rank decreases by 0.412. However, only 15.8% of overall education
    rankings effectively accounted for by the regression line. Nevertheless, there seems to be significant data.
    Notably,
    states such as Massachusetts(Overall Ranking: 1st) and Connecticut (Overall Ranking: 2nd) impact the negative
    correlation. Although highly ranked in education, boasting high scores in Math, Reading, and other International
    Exams, Massachusetts and Connecticut are ranked 41st and 48th in racial equality, respectively. Hence, the
    disparities
    in educational resources within those states seem to be contributing to the negative trend, especially with the
    lingering educational discrimination against Blacks. Again, the coefficient of determination (.158) proves the trend
    to be not so strong(high variation in the graph), but the drastically low points far from the regression model in
    Massachusetts and Connecticut in regards to overall education quality and racial equality are concerning. Hence, the
    apparent racial inequality in education proves to be a rising struggle in the United States.</p>
    <p style="font_family: verdana"></p>Finally, let's look at healthcare rankings for each state(this was 2023 Data):
    </p>
    <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless"
      src="https://plotly.com/~NRswift/85.embed" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
    <p style="font_family: Times New Roman"></p>You can see here that Vermont(Overall Healthcare Ranking: 5) and
    Maine(Overall Healthcare Ranking: 16) were not included in the distribution as they did not have rankings in regards
    to Racial Equality for Healthcare.</p>
    <h3>Analysis</h3>
    <p style="font_family: Times New Roman"></p>Here, we find a strong positive correlation between racial equality and
    overall healthcare for each state, backed by an R² of 0.691 as well as an increase in overall rank by 0.864 for
    every
    increase in equality rank. However, when it comes to states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin, although tied for an
    above-average 21st in overall healthcare rankings, their respective racial equality rankings of 32nd and 37th raise
    questions. Hence, despite 69.1 percent of the correlation of the overall rankings accounted for by the regression
    line, correlation does not necessarily mean causation here. Especially with interesting scenarios with Minnesota and
    Wisconsin, closer attention and reform towards maintaining racial equality in even adequate healthcare systems is
    needed.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    </u>
    <br>
    Although there are clear signs of America's investment in promoting
    ethnic diversity, the country can improve in maintaining
    racial equality. After all, the high variations between racial equality and overall quality in especially state
    economies and education systems exemplify existence of stable systems but low equality. Hence, there seems to be an
    imbalance between how racial and ethnic diversity is valued, even though the two types of diversity should both be
    greatly respected. Through opening up and improving opportunities for racial minorities, America can evolve as a
    country. Thank you for reading my Data Science blog post and let us keep moving forward as a beautiful America!
